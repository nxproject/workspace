# Data basics

To better understand how data is organized in NX.Workspace, tink of ***rolodexes***, the old fashion way to keep
information in a simple but yet flexible way.

## Dataset

A dataset can be thought as a rolodex, where each one keeps information on a particular subject.

## Object

The rolodex has any number of index cards, each one is an object in the dataset.

## Fields

Each card can have any number of information pieces, each piece is called a field.

## Links

Each card can refer you to another rolodex, this is called a link.

## View

Think of being able to create cut-out masks, where only certain fields can be seen.  This is called a view.
