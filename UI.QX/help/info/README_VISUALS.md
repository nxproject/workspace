## Desktop

![image](/help/info/images/Desktop.png)

The desktop is the working surface of each user in the site.  It is composed of a ***taskbar*** at the bottom 
of the desktop and can display any number of windows.

### Taskbar

The taskbar has three sections:

#### Start menu

Access to all the datastes and tools is done via the ***Start*** button:

With the exception of ceratin ***accounts*** which may have an empty Start menu, all Start menus will
have a ***user name*** entry at the top and a ***Logout*** entry at the bottom.

#### Pinned menu

The Pinned button is also used to access ***pinned** items.

#### Window taskbar button

Each active window in the desktop is assigned a button in the taskbar:

Note that the button displays the window title and icon.  The active window is shown with a ***gold asterisk***.

Clicking on the window taskbar button activates the window.  If the buton for the active wimdow is
clicked, the window will be hidden.  Clicking on a hidden window's taskbar button hows the window.

## Window

The window is the basic display element in the NX.Workspace system.  

All windows have the same format, with each item being optional, except for the ***workarea*** and 
***command bar***.

This is an example of a ***data window***:

It has a ***top toolbar***, ***workarea*** and ***command bar***.

And this is an example of a ***pick list***:

Note that all it has is the ***workarea*** and the ***command bar***.

### Top toolbar

The top toolbar is used to display functions that are specific to the window being shown.

### Workarea

The workarea holds all the data displayed in the window.  It is made up of ***fields***.

#### Field

A field holds a piece of information, like a name or a list of items.  Labels are optional for each field, although is 
common practice toinclude them.

##### Context menu

Context menus are used throught the system to display functions specific to the ***field*** or 
***button*** being selected.  You display the context menu by right-mouce clicking on the item.

You can tell which fields have context menus by the color of their labels, which change from the normal **lavender** color.

This is an example of a context menu:

### Bottom toolbar

The bottom toolbar is used to display functions that are specific to the window being shown.

### Command bar

The command bar is used for major functions.  The following buttons are normally shown in the
command bar:

* ```Close``` - Closes the window
* ```Ok``` - Accepts the request
* ```Save``` - Saves any changes and closes the window

### System command bar

The system command bar is very uncommon.  Here is an example of the system command bar:

In this case, the ***command bar*** is ***non-operational*** and shown so you can see the ***data***
window as it would be generated.

## Modal windows

Modal windows display on top of all other windows and force the user to make a decision before continuing
the process.  This is an example:

This particular window displays if you try to logout while other windows are open.

## Login

When the site is accessed and no user information is detected, the login window is shown:

Once you have given the proper credentials, a ***notification*** is displayed:
