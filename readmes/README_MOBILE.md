# Mobile Support

You can access your site from a phone or tablet device by adding ***/mobile*** to your url.  For example if you
normally acces your site using:

```
https://mysite.com
```

You can access the site from your phone by using:

```

Almost all the functionality is available in your mobile device with the exception of functionality that requires a large screen like editors.

Clicking on the ***top left*** icon displays the equivalent of the ***Start*** menu at any time that is useful to do so.

in the ***webtop*** version.

closes and saves any changes to the windows above the one that you navigate to.
