This is a WYSIWYG editor that shows both the source and final version of the text.

## Linking the help

You link in your help, which overrides the default help kept at [GitHub]() by setting the ***Help Root*** entry
in the ***Site Settings***:

## What the finished help looks like

Once linked, clicking on the ***HElp*** entry in the ***Start*** menu, displays the root page:

## Enabling help for the user

In order to have the user access help, you need to setup the ```HELP``` selector in the [***Allowed***](README_USERS.md) setting.
