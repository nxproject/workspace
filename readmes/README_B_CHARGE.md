# Charges

Charges are generated at definable dataset levels.  The can be drawn from the [rate table](README_B_RATE.md) or from
[subscriptions](README_B_SUBS.md).

In order for a charge to be created, the dataset must be a child of a dataset that either has an [account](README_D_FIELDS.md)
field or is the child of such a dataset.
