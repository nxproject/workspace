# Analyze

The Analyze tool allows you to do count and other match analysis on the data in the dataset:

## Defining the analysis

You define what is available for the analysis at the dataset level:

The **Fields** entry tells the system which fields are available in the analysis, and the **Pick**
tells the system which **Pick field** definition to use to limit the data.  Here we are using the **oneyear**
pick which is defined as:

This limits the data to just the objects for last year.  Note that there is no maximum on the number of
object used, however the larger the number of objects, the longer that it takes to load.

## Getting a predefined analysis

You can save analysis for later reuseby clicking on the **Save** button on the top left of the analysis.
From then on, you can select a saved analysis and the last saved analysis is displayed:

Which will display:

## Changing the analysis contents

Simply darg/drop firlds from the source area to either columns or rows and vice-versa to create an
analysis.  You can also change what the contents are by selecting from the drop downs in the top left
corner.
