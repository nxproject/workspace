## Why

This code represents many years of coding in many languages, operating systems computer
types and places.  It is intended to be an example of Open Source as what I wish
Open Source to be, with an MIT license.  

The idea of Open Source has intrigued me for a while now and this system has a lot of 
Open Source code from many third parties.  I provided the glue.

**Take from the code what you wish.**

And to avoid any "style" wars, the code follows my own coding style, which does not
mean that your coding style is any worse, it just means that we differ.  The same goes
for language, operating system and  whatever else you care about.  I am glad that
you care about it, but I do not care to get into any arguments.  Like a colleague
once said **Let this be a learning moment for you, not a teaching moment for me**.

Do bear with me, this is my first open source project, based on years of work
in many languages. And like any programmer, the code will change to adapt to new things.

NX.Project is based on two systems, NX.Node, which provides for the HTTP layer and
the container support, and NX.Workspace, which uses NX.Node and provides a data management
system.  You can use NX.Node by itself, but using NX.Workspace requires NX.Node.

## Which group am I in?

My plans for this project is to become a consultant and using NX.Workspace, create and support as many vertical markets as I can.  I will also provide low-cost hosting services as most end users want a turn-key system.  If you are interested in my services, contact me via this channel.

## My take on containers

The computer world is and has been in a cycle.  I begun with a "mainframe" that could be
used by one person at a time, in other words a "personal" computer, just a very big (physically, as it had 4K of memory)
"personal" computer.  Time-sharing came into play, as the big, expensive computers could
then be used by many people at the "same" time.  Each computer since became the personal computer
in the 80's, which begun with the same coputing power of the first mainframes that I  used,
it just sat on your desk.  Over time, the power of that computer grew and by linking them
together, we got "the cloud", one really big computer, but made of "litte" computers
which could "timeshare" the resources by using containers.

I like "the cloud", but not just to run a billion people on one "application", I want
to run a different application for a billion people.  The NX.Node hive is the platform for such an application
and NX.Workspce is the front end.

Imagine going to your dog walker and being able to setup a fairly complex application that
handles everything from sending out "flyers" to back room accounting, with video conferencing
and text messages thrown in.  But just for him/her.  And then doing the same, with a bit
of customization, for the sandwich shop at the corner.  And just for them.

That is what my goal is, and has been since 1983.

## What I run NX.Workspace on

We currently run various systems based from [Intel NUC](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/details/nuc.html) 
to [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/).

Some run as part of intranets and all public facing sites use SSL to provide security.

The previous incarnation of NX.Project has been used since 2018 in the legal industry.
